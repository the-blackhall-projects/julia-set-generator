## Generates a Julia set on the HTML5 Canvas thourg inverse iteration.
### Introduction
A Julia set is a fractal set in the complex plane that is defined by the behavior of a complex function at every point. To create a Julia set, you start with a complex number and plug it into a complex function repeatedly, generating a sequence of numbers. Depending on the function and the initial complex number, the sequence may either converge to a fixed point or diverge to infinity. The Julia set is the set of complex numbers for which the sequence of iterates neither converges nor diverges, but instead forms a chaotic, self-similar pattern. The set is often depicted graphically as a black-and-white image, where black represents points that belong to the Julia set, and white represents points that do not. Julia sets are known for their intricate and fascinating geometric patterns, and they have been studied extensively in mathematics, physics, and computer science.
### Inverse Iteration
Reverse iteration is a technique used to generate points of a Julia Set by working backwards from a known point that is believed to be in the set. The idea is to start with a point that is assumed to be in the Julia Set and then iteratively apply the inverse of the function that defines the Julia Set. The inverse function essentially "undoes" the effect of the original function, allowing us to work backwards in the sequence of numbers to determine whether a given point is part of the set.

To be more precise, suppose we have a point c that we believe to be in the Julia Set, and we want to determine which other points in the complex plane are also in the set. We start by iterating the function f(z) = z^2 + c starting with some initial point z_0. If the sequence of numbers generated by this iteration tends towards infinity, we assume that z_0 is not in the Julia Set. However, if the sequence stays bounded, we assume that z_0 is in the Julia Set.

To generate other points in the Julia Set using reverse iteration, we start with a point z that we want to test, and we iteratively apply the inverse of f(z), which is given by z = sqrt(z - c). We start with z and apply this inverse function repeatedly, generating a sequence of numbers that moves backwards through the iteration process. If this sequence tends towards infinity, we assume that z is not in the Julia Set. However, if the sequence stays bounded, we assume that z is in the Julia Set.

In summary, reverse iteration is a technique used to generate points of a Julia Set by working backwards from a known point in the set, applying the inverse of the function that defines the set iteratively, and checking whether the resulting sequence of numbers tends towards infinity or stays bounded.
